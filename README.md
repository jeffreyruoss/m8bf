# Phaser JS Game
Not sure what this is going to be yet. Maybe city builder, automation, survival, adventure or something else.

# Development
npm start
This just runs live-server. No bundling or compiling.

# Production
npm run bundle-js
This will bundle and compile the js into the dist folder.
index.html conditionally loads the bundled js if it's not local.
